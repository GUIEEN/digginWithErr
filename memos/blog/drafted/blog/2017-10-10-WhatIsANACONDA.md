|	|traditional Python Distribution|ANACONDA|
|-------|:-----------------------------:|-------:|
|give|just a basic platform where you have to install your desired packages manually(this even doesn't have NumPy and Pandas installed)|everything|




If you're planning to study ML and want to setting a environment for that, you may install python package through Anaconda platform.
As through installing it with Anaconda, most of all environments which needed to set up before running programs of ML or data-science will be structured without concerning your OS. Such environment like
* NumPy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* whatever !

### Update

 In addition, Anaconda provides iPython Notebook that beautifully changes the way we write code in Python. Basically, an iPython notebook contains many cells where you can readily write code and add comments (in Markdown) to your cell. The notebook is displayed right into your web browser. Take a look at an example notebook file from tensorflow
