Short Concept
* NumPy : 最適化された多次元配列をサポートし、最先端のアルゴリズムの多くはNumpyのデータ構造を使用している。
* SciPy : NumPyのデータ構造を利用、高速な数値計算手方をいくつも共有する。
* Matplotlib : Pythonを使用してグラフを作成することに関して、おそらく最も便利で高機能なライブラリ。





Whenever someone first begins taking any substantial steps into using Python for math/science/engineering, they face a confounding situation relating the packages SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, PyLab. Everything I say here is documented in detail on SciPy.org, or other places that further digging can uncover. If you want a more in depth understanding, that's the place to go. My goal here is to clarify what's going on when you look at example programs in terms of when to use what package, or more precisely, what steps you can take to determine what package/s to use for your purposes.

First, let me point out that many of the codes you will see on the web will likely have redundant calls, or will not suite your style or needs. In forums where feedback is enabled, you can often hunt for the best version. Nothing should be taken as gospel while you develop an understanding. If something works, well, it works. It may not be the best way for you in the long run, but it is a way that will work in the short term.

Instead of an accurate history of development, I'll piece together a reasonable assessment of the relative roles.
