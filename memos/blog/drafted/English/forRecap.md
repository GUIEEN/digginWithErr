## **is of**

"**Is of**" is a grammatical construction used in English in the following (and other?) contexts:

To apply a noun rather than an adjective: Thus, instead of saying "That is unimportant to me", we can say "That **is of little importance** to me". Instead of "This news is greatly significant" we say "This news **is of great** (or the greatest) **significance**". The rather more complex "**is of**" construction adds a certain level of formality and importance to the language.

In place of "is made of": a Thus, "The dress **is of** pure Thai silk". Alternatively, the building **is of** steel- reinforced concrete construction.
