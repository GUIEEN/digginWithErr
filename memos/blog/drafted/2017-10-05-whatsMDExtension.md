The extensions *.md* and *.markdown* are just text files written in [Markdown!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax. As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up
> with tags
> or formatting instructions.
