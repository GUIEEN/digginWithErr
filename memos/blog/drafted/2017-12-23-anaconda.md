```
# C:/Users//anaconda/envs/mpl33 에 설치됨
conda create --name mpl33 python=3.3 matplotlib ipython-notebook
activate mpl33
ipython notebook
```

* The first command simultaneously creates the environment and install the listed packages.
* The second command activates the new environment by prepending its location to the system path
* The third command just starts the ipython notebook so that you can test out everything

Once you've activated your environment, you can install more packages like this:
```
conda install pandas=0.12 // 버전 안쓸시 최신버전으로 설치된다.simply accept the latest available version (default)
conda install pyodbc statsmodels
```
