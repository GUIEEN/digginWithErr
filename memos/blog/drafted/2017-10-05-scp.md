### scp (Secure copy protocal)
Secure copy or SCP is a means of securely transferring computer files between a local host and a remote host or between two remote hosts. It is based on the Secure Shell (SSH) protocal, which provides a secure channel over an unsecured network in a client-server architecture, connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server.

* Generally, if you want to download a file, it will go:
```
# download: remote -> local
scp user@remote_host:remote_file local_file
```
where local_file might actually be a directory to put the file you're copying in.


* To upload a file, it's the opposite:
```
 # upload: local -> remote
scp local_file user@remote_host:remote_file
```
```
 # example
scp lose_your_self.mp3 ssd-keras@12.123.123.123:/var/tmp
```
In this example, I send a file to azure VM, using public IP.

* To copy a non empty directory from the remote computer to your computer:
```
scp -r remoteusername@192.168.1.56:/home/vrc/Desktop/www /home/ourusername/Desktop
```
